So you've been learning about IRL Streaming and there is just too many letters that you don't understand.  Let's try to break down some of the fun acronyms.

AVC/h.264: Advanced Video Codec also know as h.264 is the standard video codec for providers and streams in RTMP.  Has some licenses but is generally used everywhere.

AV1: AOMedia Video 1 (AV1) is an open, royalty-free video coding format initially designed for video transmissions over the Internet.  We can't really use AV1 for much because it encoding and coding requires so much computational power and is not supported on many devices currently.

BELABOX: Budget Encoder for Link Aggregation box, a hardware device running belabox software from belabox.net to bond multiple internet connections for a stream

HEVC/h.265: High-Efficiency Video Codec also know as h.265, is a video codec that is needs more computational power for encoding and decoding but compression uses much less bandwidth for the same video quality compared to AVC/h.264.  Has more strict licensing than AVC/h.264.

LA: Link Aggreation, or being able to bond separate network connections

OBS: Open Broadcast System, the open source software that generally does the last leg of sesnding a stream out to provider.

RIST: Reliable Internet Streaming Protocal is a modern protocal for video transmission

RTMP: Real-Time Transport Protocal, a protocal for video transmission from the Shockwave Flash days that is the main way for sending a stream direct to provider such as twitch, youtube, kick, etc.  Genereally only supports AVC/h.264 except for youtube which allows HEVC/h.265 over RTMP.

RTT: Round-Trip Time, the time in milliseconds it takes for one packet to be recieved and acknowledged.

SRT: Secure Reliable Transport Protocal, a more modern protocal for video transmission that has enhanced error correction

SRTLA: Using the SRT protocal with Link Aggregation

VOD: video on demand, saved videos of streams, generally
